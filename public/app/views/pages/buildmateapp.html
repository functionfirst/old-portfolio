            A web-based application that enables building companies and tradesmen to create estimates and tender documents,

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>
            The key features of the Buildmate application allow Users to manage a number of aspects of their projects and customer base.
            In addition to the typical features expected when creating and managing building projects and customers, the system included an
            algorithm to calculate the most cost-efficient way to purchase resources.
        </p>

        <h4>Cost-efficiency algorithn</h4>

        <p>
            When adding a resource to a project, Buildmate's cost-efficiency algorithm will automatically check if the resource already exists
            in the project. From there it checks the total resource amount against the purchase quantities available and automatically
            uses the most cost-effective combinations.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                As an example, a project requires the use of <em>15mm nail fix pipe clips</em>, these clips are used in a number of different tasks and are
                used in sets of 20-30 at a time. These resources are usually sold in packs of either 50 or 200, where the larger packs are more cost-effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Buildmate system will look at all the tasks in the project, identify that there are 150 clips required across the whole project. It then
            scans the pack sizes to calculate whether it's more efficient to buy 3 packs of 50 clips or 1 pack of 200 clips while still having 50 clips left over.
            </p>
