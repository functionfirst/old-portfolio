			The initial scope of the Gulf Plates project was to design and build a web application that could facilitate the sale

		<h3>Summary</h3>

		<p>
			The final real-time auction system was developed using the MEAN stack, with AngularJS working on the front-end as a single-page application while
			Node, Express and MongoDB provided a Restful API which was used to consume auction data and manage user authentication. The real-time nature of the app was
			facilitated by socket.io which allows for real-time bi-directional communication between web clients and the server.

			<li>
				<h5>Extended bidding</h5>
				
				<p>
					Each auction could be configured with a scheduled finish and extension time, if a new bid was received during the closing
					minutes the auction finish time would be automatically extended by the configured time. This allowed other users the opportunity
					to counter a bid and also prevented auction 'sniping' where users attempt to secure the item at a cheaper rate by placing a bid
					at the last minute.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Incremental Bidding</h5>

				<p>
					Given the pressure and time sensitive nature of placing a bid, the UI for Gulf Plates was designed to be as simple and quick as possible
					to use.
				</p>

				<p>
					Rather than entering a bid value each time the auction value changed, the user instead chose an increment amount from a select box.
					Add this increment value combined with the current auction value, a new bid value was automatically calculated. Keeping the increment
					value the same, the User could then simply click Place Bid using this new value. This reduced the bidding process to a single click.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Automated Bidding</h5>

				<p>
					As incremental bidding still required constant attention on your auctions an Autobid system was also introduced to Gulf Plates.
					This allowed Users to set a maximum Bid value for the current auction. When other users placed a bid, the autobid system would
					check against any autobids logged in the system. Where these Autobids existed a new bid was automatically submitted on behalf
					of the user.
				</p>

				<p>
					In situations where multiple autobids existed the internal system would identify the second highest Autobid and outbid it
					in favour of the user with the highest Autobid value.
